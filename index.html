        <h2>Week1: Programming Design Systems</h2>
        <blockquote>"Managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, 
            but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that 
            interact with each other.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>Problem resolution skills are integral to the success of any organization today. In the quote, 
            managers are informed that they should tackle an issue in isolation. Instead, 
            they must invest in understanding the various systems that impact and alleviate the issue appro-priately.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Managers do not solve problems, the manage messes.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The quote could be an incredible hint as to why some companies struggle with the same set of issues for an extended duration. Managers are not addressing the problem but the resultant messes, which allows it to gradually grow to extraordinary proportions and impair the company's performance. Thus, there is a need to gain valuable problem-solving skills to give the venture an edge in the market.

        <blockquote>
            "Sometimes I challenge my students to try to think of any human decision that occurs without a feedback loop.” 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Competent individuals and organizations leverage data-driven decision-making to gain a competitive advantage over others. However, this requires an accurate collection, or-ganization, and analysis of information within an organization to ensure that the choices made are desirable and positively impact the venture's performance. Managers must also design a feedback loop meant to review and learn from the situations that have affected the business at various points.

        <h2>Week2: You look like a thing, and I love you.</h2>
        <blockquote>"Okay, so while technically disabling the car does stop from crashing.”</blockquote>
        <p>
            It’s  suggests that while trying to review the AIs and improve them to benefit people today, addressing the technical issues will not stop it from causing harm to its users. There are numerous cases in which AIs have done inconvenient things since their data had confus-ing material. Thus, there is a need to carefully regulate the AI systems' development to en-sure that no single corrupt data is used. This makes it continue hurting people rather than better their lives.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Another strategy for fixing class imbalance is to somehow change the data so that there are roughly equal numbers of training examples in every category.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In my view, the quote calls for proper management of the data used in AI systems development. However, more research needs to be done to ensure that only quality and gen-uine data is used to develop these systems to ensure proper functioning. This is because AI systems are meant to mimic human behavior and to perform other human functions. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "A self-driving car that freaked out when it went over a bridge for the first time is an example of overfitting.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This part  emphasizes the importance of training data in AI development and per-formance. If the data is corrupt or insufficient, then the problem of overfitting could be en-countered as described above. Based on the training information, the vehicle felt that all the roads had grass on either side and when it encountered the bridge with no grass, it did not know the best measure to take. Thus, further studies need to be done to ensure that high-quality data are used to develop AI systems to limit the harm they can cause in society.

        <h2>Week3: Notes on Failure</h2>
        <blockquote>
            “Whoever battles with monsters had better see that it does not turn him into a mon-ster. If you gaze too long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back at you.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I think Oates uses this quote to try and warn us about constant thoughts of failure. When we keep pondering on whether we will fail or lose, it is inevitable that we will lose our focus and eventually fail. Rather than thinking and worrying about failure, one should focus on doing everything to succeed. This may also apply to success. When you keep tell-ing yourself you are a winner; you will become one.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Nothing gets easier with the passage of time, not even the passage of time.” 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Indeed, the process does not become easier with time. In my opinion, it’s the person going through the process that adapts and becomes stronger as time passes. As time passes, one learns from previous mistakes and does not repeat the same error. In the end, time makes us stronger, and success is inevitable.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “One is born not to suffer but to negotiate with suffering, to choose or invent forms to accommodate it.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Suffering is unpreventable in life, and only the strongest thrive. In human nature, when faced with a problem, you do not leave it unsolved; suffering only makes you stronger and efficient. When we work through tough times, it prepares us for future battles.

        <h2>Week4:Thinking in systems: A primer.</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This sentiment is designed to enlighten people on the importance of systems-based culture and change. Therefore, system-based design leverages institution-wide thinking to help capture the complexity of various systems addressed within design practice. The goal of system-oriented culture and design is to help designers understand that change is based on their practices and not objects as it was in the past. Thus, they need to engage massively in decision-making and policy formulation to ensure the desired outcomes are achieved.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "A graphic designer is someone who communicates a piece of content in shape and color. This work can take many forms, but up until recently, it mainly consisted of printed products in the form of posters, business cards, book covers, etc.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This sentence provided as a response to a graphic designer's role, and from it, I have learned that architects share their information using shapes and color. Thus, a designer's work is to communicate different information through posters, book covers, and other me-diums. Besides, they are tasked with using their hands or the available computer software to communicate their ideas.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Even in web design where the page metaphor is still prevalent, it seems limiting to define the design to just the styles of the page”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            It is focused on further reviewing and determining the best way to define the design. It is not merely limited to the styles and shapes used in developing the page but the design-er's primary message. Therefore, this is a call for designers to focus on their work's physical aspects and ensure that they offer quality content to users.

        <h2>Week5 : Design as the Machines Come to Life</h2>
        <blockquote>“Petri dishes are also called cell-culture dishes.”</blockquote>
        <p>
            Petri dishes are called cell culture dishes due to the control and retention of the originality of the bacteria they are made for. The prevention of eternal influence and organization means that the dish regulates the behaviors and contacts other different cultured organisms hence retaining originality.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Under these conditions, contamination from airborne germs rarely occurs.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The condition is referred to include the covering of the dish, which was initially being used to study bacteria. The petri dish covering ensured less contamination from the airborne germ; hence, the bacteria retained their originality features, forms, and traits. This meant that the said modification greatly reduced the contamination.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “A minor modification of the plating technique of Koch.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The modification of Koch techniques involved the covering of the dish with a glass lid when experimenting. This means it improved the previously existing practice of having the bacte-ria and organisms on an open plate. This covering up is what aided Petri dishes that were covered in a bid to reduce airborne organism contamination of the specimens. The covering plate technique gave birth to the now-used Petri dishes in specimen testing and examina-tion.

        <h2>Week6: Ruined by Design</h2>
        <blockquote>
            “You can change a company that’s afraid of change, you can change a company that finds change uncomfortable, but you cannot change a company that does not want change.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Change must come from within an individual, and for a person to accept change, he/she must want it. If a person is uncomfortable with change, they can be easily convinced by being given the positive impacts the change will bring. Still, if a person does not entirely want change, it is impossible to convince change. I think people who reject change do not want to leave their comfort zone and may feel that they have lost control over their territo-ries and are afraid to take risks. But change is good and brings in a new and fresh perspec-tive.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Ten years ago, before the iPad and iPhone were mainstream, the average person had an attention span of about twelve seconds. Now research suggests that there’s been a drop from twelve to eight seconds…shorter than the attention of the average goldfish, which is nine seconds.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In this age, people have become slaves to phones and other gadgets. An average per-son cannot go for a few minutes without checking their phones. Essential activities that need full attention suffer because of this divided attention. It is funny how a mere goldfish can concentrate more than a human. This shows how these modern electronic gadgets have had negative impacts on our function ability.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Social media has been described as more addictive than alcohol and cigarettes and is now so entrenched in the lives of young people that it is no longer possible to ignore it when talking about young people’s mental health.” 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I feel that social media is more addictive than drugs because I also spend so much time on social media; while I could have been doing something more fruitful, I waste it all browsing the net. Social media is a medium for peer pressure; you may feel inadequate or inferior to the people you see on social media, which may increase the risk of depression and affect your mental health.
